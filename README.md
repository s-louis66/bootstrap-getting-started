# bootstrap-getting-started
Small Bootstrap page so I could get familiar with Bootstrap and what it can do.
It was made from a free, Bootstrap theme and changed several things but nothing too spectacular. 
The goal for this project was to get me used to Bootstrap, and also, to make it into a basic,
custom Wordpress theme which I did using the XAMPP program to work on it locally.
Features include HTML, CSS, and JavaSCript.
